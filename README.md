Simple PHP interface to my X10 Home Automation controls.

There are three files - all ending in "state" - which keep a record of the current state of a device.
I have included copies of the bash scripts which actually do the work - this may or may not be of any
particular use to anyone, but it might at least make it easier to understand how it all works...
